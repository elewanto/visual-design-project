Caveats:
"1. Due to confidentiality constraints, sub-national death counts and rates are suppressed when the number of deaths is less than"
"10. Figures representing infant deaths and births have additional constraints for national and local data. More information:"

"2. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:"

"3. About sub-national population figures for regions, divisions, states and counties: population figures for 1999 are from the"
"1990-1999 series of bridged-race intercensal estimates of the July 1 resident population; population figures for 2000 and 2010"
